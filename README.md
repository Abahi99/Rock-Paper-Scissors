<strong>Rock Paper Scissors Project</strong>

JavaScript Project from The Odin Project. 

<strong>Project Reflections:</strong>

I created the logic behind this game. The user will play against a computer that has the ability to choose randomly Rock, Paper, or Scissor to compute with the user that has the ability to choose by just clicking in the wanted button. The winner should win five round first.

It wasn't hard for me to create this simple game. However, I struggle a little bit on controlling the result element that I created to just show the winner and disappear.
